# ImageCrawler
Crawler from an interview problem

# Problem
Create a crawler that gets a list of urls from a database, gets each url, counts how many images on that url and saves that to the database, this happens every 2 hours.
Create a frontend with 2 charts: bar chart with time and count for each url for the last 24 hours, chart that sorts all the urls by count currently.
